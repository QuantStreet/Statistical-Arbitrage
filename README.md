# Statistical-Arbitrage
### End to end development
Still a very much work in progress with a lot of comments for changes.

2.26.18 Update (The updated code is not in the repository):  
Much of the updated code is now working very well. I'm in the process of cleaning up the code and making it more readable.  
I am still debating about how much of it to make public. My results are extremely promising with a sharpe ratio of over 7 inclusive of transaction costs. I have yet to manually confirm the out of sample results though.  I also started working on an alpha blend methodology and other alpha signals that would work outside of the test case universe. 

For the posted code: I deleted the fully working code for the covariance estimation. I spoke to a few funds and it seems  
that the estimation concept would be extremely valuable for producing superior performance.
